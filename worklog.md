Task ID: 1
Agent: Research/STORM
Task: Phase 0 research for Python DS course

Work Log:
- Read project root; confirmed Next.js 16 + Tailwind 4 + shadcn/ui + Prisma + Framer Motion + z-ai-web-dev-sdk + zustand stack (all relevant for Section 3 SPA findings).
- Ran 12 web_search queries via z-ai CLI covering: Python DS skills demand 2025; salary Peru Lima; Gradual Release pedagogy; Tailwind 4 + shadcn SPA patterns; Framer Motion perf; spaced repetition for syntax; sklearn Pipeline+Optuna+SHAP; pytest+CI; constructivism in CS ed; course platform success patterns (freeCodeCamp/Kaggle Learn); responsive overflow pitfalls; Python cert value; LATAM DS soft skills; pandas real-world projects; zustand persist; online course completion pitfalls.
- Cross-referenced 5 independent salary sources for Peru (Levels.fyi, Glassdoor, SalaryExpert, Talently, CosmoQuick).
- Identified Tailwind v4 + shadcn known Radix transparency bug (GitHub #17137) — actionable for build phase.
- Validated Gradual Release has evolved to 4 phases (I Do / We Do / You Do Together / You Do) per Corwin + Ferry 2024.
- Mapped each of the 10 outline sections to a portfolio-grade mini-project mirroring a real DA/DS job task.

Stage Summary:
- Delivered a ~1,450-word research brief with 4 sections: (1) 15 CV keywords + 5 production project archetypes + 3 cert recommendations + Peru salary ranges; (2) 5 pedagogy principles + 3 anti-patterns; (3) 5 SPA/Tailwind best practices + 3 mobile-on-desktop pitfalls with fixes; (4) per-section must-have sub-skills + mini-project ideas for all 10 outline modules.
- Key actionable findings for downstream agents: (a) course must use I Do/We Do/You Do Together/You Do pattern with executable feedback after every "You Do"; (b) prefer CSS/LazyMotion animations over JS for perf, animate only transform/opacity; (c) use Zustand+persist for localStorage progress with schema versioning; (d) Tailwind v4 migration requires fixing Radix Select transparency bug; (e) course projects should be the 5 production archetypes (churn, RFM segmentation, forecasting, EDA report, scoring+API) — these double as portfolio pieces; (f) CS50P + Kaggle badges are the highest-signal certifications to recommend.
- Source-quality honesty: salary/Peru data and Gradual Release model are strongly corroborated; LATAM soft-skills and cert-ROI claims are weaker (anecdotal); niche tool-adoption rankings for 2025-2026 LATAM relied on training-data inference. Recommended: orchestrator commission a Phase 0.5 scrape of actual LinkedIn Peru DS job postings to harden keyword ranking.
